In case you want to scale down sprites and keep good and smooth quality, use the well known software Adobe Photoshop.

From there, go to the upper menu tab and click "Image>Image Size". Then adjust the Width and Height to your heart's content.

Finally, on the lower part of this same window click and choose "Bicubic Sharper (best for reduction)".

Save and Voilá!
