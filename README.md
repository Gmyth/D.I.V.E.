## High Concept ##
The game is fast-paced jump & attack platformers. The intensity and the timer will keep pushing the player to move fast! Faster than the enemiesâ€™ reaction! Prevent the rebooting of this futuristic cyber virtual world with Lyu and save his sinking memory. 


## Features ##
Blink Combat: High speed moving & attacking to solve challenges/puzzles in a blink
The enemy will normally be eliminated by one single attack.  But some enemies can block attacks

**Fragile but dexterous** 

- Each Hit is fatal!But lyu is capable to dodge with hyper speed movement

**Only way to kill Elites and bosses is to damage hard to their weakness**

- They are usually in giant size, the way to defeat them is to attack hard on their weakness which should be a small but obvious spot on their body

**Unlockable advanced mobility and attack ability**

- Fever ( Hyperspeed + Timefreeze)
- Charged Dash

## Design Goal ##
**Familiarity**: The game is designed to allow the platformer-experienced and action combat-experienced to utilize their previous experience in-game. With these previous experiences, they can find some degree of familiarity in-game.

**Satisfaction**:  With this familiarity, with the combination of combat and platformer, the fast-paced high-speed in-game experience will bring the enormous juiciness to grant player instant satisfaction.

**Growth**:  The progression of player and character skill should be very obvious to notice by energy management, control,and path planning. A huge skill should form while comparing the late-game experience with early games.

**Precision**:  The design will emphasize the precision and timing of the button pressing. An energy system will ensure players can get rewards for precise attacks and penalties for unnecessary input.

**Intensity**:  Each epic moment of player will get highlighted and rewards in different ways. And every unwise decision will put players into disadvantage instantly.

**Replayability**:	   The level is designed to be short for replay. With the fast growth curve of player skill, players will get encouraged to replay the level for a better score.

## Risk ##
**Art Asset**:  The Art has became our first concern for this project. We have already rearranged our schedule and scope for better art production.  Considering the art work always takes a large amount of working time and filled with uncertainty, we will definitely keep tracking and rearrange our development schedule.

**Story**: 	 In the past production, we have uncertainty about the weight of the story versus gameplay. At this point, we have rearranged the story to a simpler version so that we have more time to polish other critical part.

## Expectations ##
At the end of Spring, 2020, we expect the game to have two completed chapters with identical art theme. Each chapter will have 3 separate level and one boss fight. One new mechanic will get introduced in the beginning of the second chapter. The story will be incomplete at the end of chapter II.
