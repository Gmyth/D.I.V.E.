## High Concept ##
The game is fast-paced jump & attack platformers. The intensity and the timer will keep pushing the player to move fast! Faster than the enemies’ reaction! Prevent the rebooting of this futuristic cyber virtual world with Lyu and save his sinking memory. 


## Features ##
Blink Combat: High speed moving & attacking to solve challenges/puzzles in a blink
The enemy will normally be eliminated by one single attack.  But some enemies can block attacks

**Fragile but dexterous** 

- Each Hit is fatal!But lyu is capable to dodge with hyper speed movement

**Only way to kill Elites and bosses is to damage hard to their weakness**

- They are usually in giant size, the way to defeat them is to attack hard on their weakness which should be a small but obvious spot on their body

**Unlockable advanced mobility and attack ability**

- Fever ( Hyperspeed + Timefreeze)
- Charged Dash

## Design Goal ##
**Familiarity**: The game is designed to allow the platformer-experienced and action combat-experienced to utilize their previous experience in-game. With these previous experiences, they can find some degree of familiarity in-game.

**Satisfaction**:  With this familiarity, with the combination of combat and platformer, the fast-paced high-speed in-game experience will bring the enormous juiciness to grant player instant satisfaction.

**Growth**:  The progression of player and character skill should be very obvious to notice by energy management, control,and path planning. A huge skill should form while comparing the late-game experience with early games.

**Precision**:  The design will emphasize the precision and timing of the button pressing. An energy system will ensure players can get rewards for precise attacks and penalties for unnecessary input.

**Intensity**:  Each epic moment of player will get highlighted and rewards in different ways. And every unwise decision will put players into disadvantage instantly.

**Replayability**:	   The level is designed to be short for replay. With the fast growth curve of player skill, players will get encouraged to replay the level for a better score.

## Risk ##
**Art Asset**:  The Art has became our first concern for this project. We have already rearranged our schedule and scope for better art production.  Considering the art work always takes a large amount of working time and filled with uncertainty, we will definitely keep tracking and rearrange our development schedule.

**Story**: 	 In the past production, we have uncertainty about the weight of the story versus gameplay. At this point, we have rearranged the story to a simpler version so that we have more time to polish other critical part.

## Expectations ##
At the end of Spring, 2020, we expect the game to have two completed chapters with identical art theme. Each chapter will have 3 separate level and one boss fight. One new mechanic will get introduced in the beginning of the second chapter. The story will be incomplete at the end of chapter II.
